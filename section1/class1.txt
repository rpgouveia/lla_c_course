## Class 1 - What is a Variable? ##
# Introduction #
A variable is a named location in memory used to store data while a program runs. 
Variables allow programs to remember values, perform calculations, and make decisions based on input or stored data.

# Why Do I Need Variables? #
In C, a variable must be declared before it can be used. 
A declaration specifies the variable's type (what kind of data it will hold), its name, and optionally its initial value.

type name = initial_value;

Example:
int personID = 1;

int is the type (an integer).
personID is the name of the variable.
1 is the initial value stored in that variable.

# Best Practices for Naming Variables #
Use meaningful names that describe what the variable represents. 
This helps you and others understand the code later. 
Avoid meaningless names like x or temp unless they are used in a very short and specific context.

Good:
float employeeHoursWorked;

Bad:
float x;

** Summary ** 
Variables are essential in any program. 
In C, you declare variables by specifying a type, name, and optionally an initial value. 
Understanding how to use and name them correctly is one of the first steps in writing clean, functional C code.
