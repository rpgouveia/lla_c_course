### How to read a manpage ###
Listen, I understand that you know how to read. The point of this section is not to teach you how to read.

Instead, I want you to understand the important and power of man pages.

### Man ###
When you write code in C, as we discussed in the previous lesson, we depend heavily on functions that we didn't write. 
And as any good developer knows, when you depend on someone elses code base, its really important that they have documentation. 
Man pages are the documentation for these functions.

man malloc

### Function Prototype ###
In a man page, you see a couple things. 
The first is the prototype, which describes the types expected to be used in the function parameters and return value. 
This is extremely important to know, because confusing the return types from functions can lead to memory corruption issues if not handled correctly. 
Also, the function expects for the parameters to be shaped a certain way.

### Function Description ###
Next, the function will describe what it does. PLEASE READ THESE. 
I have encountered so many programmers who THINK they know what a function does just based on the name of the function. 
And most of the time they're correct. 
BUT, it's extremely common for edge cases to arise in these functions that when encountered, can lead to a crash or security failure. 
Understand what the function does.

### Function Return Value ##
The return value will tell you what the expected return value is in a good state or an error state. 
It's extremely important to always check your return values to see if an error occured.
