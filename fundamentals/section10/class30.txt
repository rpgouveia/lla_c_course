Get Opt
In this video, we discuss the use of the getopt library, and how we can use it to parse command line flags from the user to perform certain functionality.

Using the getopt library in the following loop, we can parse the command line arguments passed to our program to capture the intent from the user.

#include <getopt.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	int c = 0;

	while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "nf:") != -1) {
		switch(c) {
			case 'f':
				...
				break;
			case 'n':
				...
				break;
		}
	}
}

Based on this, now we can use flags like -n or -f in our program and execute logic based on those flags!
