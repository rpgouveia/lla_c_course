### Introduction to File Descriptors ###

In this section, we're going to start using files. Here's how this works.

File Descriptors
Eventually, when we ask the kernel for a file to be opened through a system call in a library, the kernel will just return a number to us. ...why? 
Didn't we ask for a file?

Yes.

A file descriptor is a number used by the kernel to track (describe) what file specifically you're talking about when you do file operations

You've already seen this
In Linux, every program you run has three file descriptors open by default

0: stdin - a file that represents the input to your program from the command line
1: stdout - a file that represents the output of your program to the command line
2: stderr - a file that represents the output of your program, but containing only errors
