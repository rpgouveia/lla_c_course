Arrays in C
Introduction
In the variables section, we learned about how to create variables. 
But let’s say you wanted to store several numbers in your program—maybe a list of employee IDs. 
You might be tempted to do something like this:

int id1 = 1;
int id2 = 2;
int id3 = 3;

where id1 is the ID of employee 1, id2 is the ID of employee 2, etc.

This works for a few values, but what if you had 100 or 1,000 IDs to store? This approach becomes messy and impossible to maintain.

There’s a better solution: arrays.

What Is an Array?
An array is a way to store a collection of values of the same type in a single, continuous block of memory. 
Instead of declaring many individual variables, you can group them together under one name.

Arrays:
- Keep your code cleaner
- Make it easier to loop through multiple values
- Use memory more efficiently

Declaring an Array
To declare an array, you specify the type of the elements, the name of the array, and the number of elements you want to store.

int employeeIDs[5];

This creates space in memory for 5 integers, all grouped together.

Setting Values in an Array
You can assign values to each element using square brackets:

employeeIDs[0] = 101; // First element
employeeIDs[1] = 102; // Second element
employeeIDs[2] = 103;
employeeIDs[3] = 104;
employeeIDs[4] = 105; // Fifth and final element

Important: Arrays in C are zero-indexed — the first element is at position 0.

Reading Values from an Array
You can read from the array the same way:

printf("ID at index 2: %d\n", employeeIDs[2]); // Outputs: 103

Initializing an Array
You can also initialize an array when you declare it:

int employeeIDs[5] = {101, 102, 103, 104, 105};

Why Arrays Matter in This Course
As you build the Employee Database project later in this course, you’ll use an array to store your list of employees. 
Instead of a bunch of separate variables, you’ll create an array of struct types — where each struct represents one employee.

Arrays let us organize and access that list in a structured, efficient way.

** Summary **
Arrays:
- Store multiple values of the same type
- Make your code cleaner and easier to work with
- Are essential for any real program that handles more than a couple values

You’ll use arrays constantly in C. Mastering them now will make your life easier throughout this course.
